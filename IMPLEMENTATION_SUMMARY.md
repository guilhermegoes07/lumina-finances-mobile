### ✅ 3. Investment Savings Box (Fully Implemented)

**Models & Calculations:**
- Created `SavingsBox` model with:
  - Basic fields: name, initialAmount, entryDate, exitDate, cdiRate, description
  - Calculation methods:
    - `getCurrentValue()`: Calculates value with compound interest
    - `getGrossProfit()`: Calculates raw profit
    - `getIncomeTax()`: Applies Brazilian IR table:

## Technical Details

### Architecture
- **State Management**: Provider pattern (existing)
- **Data Persistence**: 
  - SQLite for categories (via DatabaseService)
  - SharedPreferences for transactions and savings boxes
- **User Isolation**: All data scoped by user email

### Code Quality
- Backward compatible with existing data
- Migration logic for isPending field
- Proper error handling in async operations
- Consistent UI/UX with existing app
- Dark mode support throughout

### Testing
- Created unit tests for Transaction model (isPending flag)
- Created unit tests for SavingsBox calculations
- Tests cover: profit, tax, IOF, edge cases (future dates, etc.)
